A simple but modern portfolio.

## Overview

This is my portfolio, meant to summarize and display some of my life's accomplishments!

### Features

- **Modern Design**: Using simple shapes, the design is meant to have you focus more on the content while still catching your eye!
- **Fully responsive**: The design was made to fit perfectly across all devices.
- **Single page layout**: This is a single-page website.

### Built with
- **React**
- **Figma**
- **react-swipeable**
- **react-spring**

### Goals

To create a stylish portfolio highlighting both of my passions.

## Getting Started

If you want to use this yourself, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skyfalir/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **start live server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see some errors in the console. (related to soundcloud's embed specifically) 

### Additional information
- I plan on updating this further after grading.
- one design choice was altered after the initial design, so some one or two classnames might not make sense placement-wise.
